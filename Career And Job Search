21. Help me write a professional email.
This is a clear but very general request. It gives no information about:
The sender
The recipient
The purpose of the email
The desired outcome
The tone
As a result, responses to this prompt often rely on generic templates or one-size-fits-all formatting.

Better version: “I work for the company X, and want to reach out to a client of company Y, regarding Z. Help me write a professional email where I discuss this problem A, and provide some of my inputs B for it. I’d like to take action C regarding it and see if their company is comfortable regarding it. Make the tone professional yet complying so it doesn’t come out too rude or too knowing, as the email is to seek collaboration on the problem and not one up to them.” 
What Makes the Better Prompt More Powerful:
| Feature                          | Why It Matters                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Contextual Clarity**           | You specify your role (*company X*), the recipient (*company Y*), and the subject (*problem Z*), giving the AI or reader a clear setup.                         |
| **Defined Structure**            | You break the email into **problem (A)**, **your inputs (B)**, and **desired action (C)**, which helps shape a strong narrative.                                |
| **Collaboration-Centric Intent** | You're not just informing—you’re inviting dialogue. That’s essential for professional tone and relationship-building.                                           |
| **Tone Guidance**                | By asking for a tone that’s *professional yet complying*, you reduce the risk of sounding arrogant or condescending, especially in cross-company communication. |
| **Soft Power Awareness**         | You’ve included emotional intelligence by emphasizing not “one-upping” the recipient—an often overlooked nuance in business writing.                            |

Advance Version: “I’m reaching out from [Company X] to a client at [Company Y] regarding [topic Z]. The email needs to address [problem A], share my thoughts and suggested approach [input B], and propose [action C]. I want the tone to reflect professionalism and collaborative intention—neither assertive nor submissive, but diplomatically confident to open the door for joint problem-solving. Can you help me draft this email in that voice?”

22. Help me write a thank-you email after an interview.
This is functional and polite, but it lacks depth. It doesn't provide:
Context of the interview
The role or company
Who the recipient is
Any reinforcement of qualifications or enthusiasm
A strategic tone

Better version: “I interviewed for the position X at company Y with their interviewer panel of department Z. Help me write a thank you email, that could help highlight my qualifications A and qualities B that would make me appear a perfect candidate for the position. Make the tone professional, confident and thankful while also showing enthusiasm for the possible outcome.”

What Makes the Better Prompt More Effective:
| Factor                            | Why It Matters                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Role + Department Specificity** | Identifying *position X*, *company Y*, and *department Z* makes it easier to tailor the tone and content to that team's culture and goals.         |
| **Self-Reinforcing Strategy**     | Including *qualifications A* and *qualities B* shifts this from a generic thank-you to a subtle *second pitch*—reasserting why you're a great fit. |
| **Tone Control**                  | Requesting a *professional, confident, and thankful* tone ensures the message strikes the perfect balance of humility and self-assurance.          |
| **Outcome-Oriented Energy**       | Expressing *enthusiasm for the possible outcome* reminds the employer you're invested—not just in the interview, but in the future of the role.    |
| **Personal Brand Alignment**      | You're taking ownership of how you want to be perceived—not just as grateful, but as *the best candidate for the job*.                             |

Advance additions that could be made to the better version: Mention any specific moment from the interview that you can reference to show that you were actively engaged. Also, if possible, ask help weave in how your experience with [tool/skill/project] directly aligns with something discussed during the panel.
