# Better-Prompts
Better Prompts — a series for smarter AI use  I’ll be taking a common AI prompt that works but isn’t great — and turn it into one that’s sharper, clearer, and gets better results.  

This is for anyone who uses tools like ChatGPT – And want to stop settling for “good enough” AI answers.  

While this collection was originally created for ChatGPT, these prompts work great with other AI models like Claude, Grok,  Gemini, Hugging Face Chat, Llama, Mistral, and more.

ChatGPT is a web interface created by OpenAI that provides access to their GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language models. The underlying models, like GPT-4o and GPT-o1, are large language models trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text. Like other AI chat interfaces, you can provide prompts and have natural conversations with the AI, which will generate contextual responses based on the conversation history and your inputs.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT and other AI chat models.
